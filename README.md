# TTT-CrateSystem
A TTT Crate System

This is a crate system made for TTT but might work for other gamemodes. It has a admin system for giving people crates/money/items.
It also contains crafting/drops/and community shop. This is all to give players a reason to keep playing as they might have items 
tied into the game and won't want to give up his hard work. If enough people ask I will be adding a XP system to this which would only work for TTT. This is free to download/use/modify. I'm 
mainly building this as a base for others to crate a XP skin for it. I do ask that if you crate your own skin for this that you will
share it with me as I did create the base that you are using. And you're kinda a dick if you don't.
